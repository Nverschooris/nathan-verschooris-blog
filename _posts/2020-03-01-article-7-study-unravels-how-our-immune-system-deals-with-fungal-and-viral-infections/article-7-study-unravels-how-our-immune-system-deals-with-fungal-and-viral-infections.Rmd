| General topic?               | The researchers studied the possible immune system responses to co-infection.|
| Procedure/what was examined? | They confronted a white blood cell with two pathogens at the same time: a virus and a fungal cell. They then studied its reaction using advanced microscopy techniques.|
| Conclusions/discovery?       | White Blood Cells expel the fungus much more easily after ingesting it (regardless of the type of virus). This could be the white blood cell's reaction to focus on the viral infection.
 |
| Remaining questions?         | What is the real advantage of this mechanism? Is it more effective against this or that infection ? |
