| General topic?               |The immune system deteriorates in older people. Researchers have found that a drug for genital warts can help the immune system recover, including a better response to vaccines. |
| Procedure/what was examined? |They followed the immune activity of the germinal centre (= formation of T follicular helper cells) in elderly mice and humans and tried to find ways to enhance this activity. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | After vaccination, older individuals (mice and humans) produce less of these follicular cells resulting in a deficiency of antibodies that diminish the effect of the vaccine. Researchers have shown that these cells actually receive fewer stimulants from other immune cells in older people. Since genital wart cream has the effect of boosting the cells that produce these stimulants, the indirect effect of the drug is to restore the proper functioning of the germinal centre (and thus immunity). 
 |
| Remaining questions?         |Why does germinal center activity change with age? |
