## Vocabulary 

| Words from the text | Synonym/explanation in English | french translation |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------|
|RNA|ribonucleic acid, a nucleic acid present in all living cells. Its principal role is to act as a messenger carrying instructions from DNA for controlling the synthesis of proteins|ARN|
|single-cell RNA analysis|set of molecular biology techniques that allows the analysis of genetic information (DNA, RNA, etc.) at the scale of a single cell, thanks to the optimization of new generation sequencing technologies. This technology makes it possible to study cellular differences with optimal resolution and thus to understand the particularity of a cell within its micro-environment.|séquencage de cellule unique|
|cytotoxic|poisonous to living cells|cytotoxique|
|somewhat|to a certain extent|assez, quelque peu|
|set out smthg|lay out, arrange smthg |entreprendre|
|subset|set within a larger set|sous-ensemble|
|turn out|prove to be the case|s'avérer|

| General topic?               |Analysis of the types of immune cells (especially T-cells) that supercentenarians possess in order to understand why they are more resistant to certain diseases such as infections and cancers.   |
| Procedure/what was examined? |1) First, the researchers analyzed the circulating immune cells of a group of supercentenarians (using the single-cell RNA analysis) and compared these results with the immune cell composition of a younger group. 2)Then they focused on T cell composition based on the type of marker on the cell surface: CD4 (normally non-cytotoxic) or CD8 (tendency to be cytotoxic). 3) Finally, they analyzed in detail the blood cells of 2 supercentenarians |
| Conclusions/discovery?       |The researchers noted that supercentenarians had far more cytotoxic T-cells than young subjects. They also realized that these killer cells are not CD8-positive as initially thought but CD4-positive (therefore normally non-cytotoxic) which have acquired a cytotoxic status. These particular CD4-positive cells are actually clones of the same initial cell and seem to be a characteristic of old age. Finally, the researchers believe that these cytotoxic cells could be the reason for the good health of supercentenarians.
