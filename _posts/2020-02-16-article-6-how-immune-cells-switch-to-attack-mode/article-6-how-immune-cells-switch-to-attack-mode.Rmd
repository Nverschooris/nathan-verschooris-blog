| General topic?               |researchers have investigated how macrophages move from passive to aggressive mode. |
| Procedure/what was examined? |They observed in detail what happens to macrophages after putting them in contact with LPS (molecules that activate Toll-like receptors and are responsible for their behavioural changes). |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | After confrontation with LPS, macrophages absorb more glucose from their environment in order to convert it into acetyls. These acetyls are actually used to make the genes that code for inflammatory messenger release and cell mobility more readable (these genes are therefore much more exploited). The macrophage is thus ready to defend the organism. Process control could allow a finer regulation of the immune response and help to cure diseases such as diabetes or rheumatism.
